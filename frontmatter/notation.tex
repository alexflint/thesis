\vspace*{20mm}{\Large\bf\begin{center}Notation\end{center}}\label{sec:Notation}Throughout this thesis, the following conventions will be used fortypesetting mathematics unless otherwise indicated:\begin{itemize}\item \textbf{Sets} are written in calligraphic type: $\mathcal{S}$.\item \textbf{Fields} are written in upper case: $\mathbb{F}$. Inparticular, $\Reals$ denotes the reals and $\Ints$ denotes the integers.\item \textbf{Vectors} are written in lower case bold: $\vect{x}$. Vectors are usually column vectors,with elements specified by subscript index(\eg $\vect{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$).\item \textbf{Matrices} are written in upper case: $H$.The entry in the $i$\th row and $j$\th column is$H_{i,j}$.\item \textbf{Conditional probabilities} are written $P(A ~|~ B)$. Inmost cases $A$ and $B$ will correspond to the event that certainvariables take on certain values, for example: $P(x ~|~ y)$.\item \textbf{Expectations} of $x$ with respect to a distribution $p$are written $\Expected_p[x]$.\item \textbf{Gradients} of $y$ with respect to $x$ are written $\Deriv{y}{x}$.\item \textbf{Inner products} for geometric quantities are written$\vect{x}\cdot\vect{y}$. In the more general context of Hilbert spaceswe switch to the notation $\bigl\langle\vect{x},\vect{y}\bigr\rangle$.\item Where there is a need to differentiate the estimated and truevalues of a quantity $y$, the former will be written $\hat{y}$ and thelatter $y^*$.\end{itemize}
