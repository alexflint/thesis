abstract = {Dynamic programming (DP) has been a useful tool for a variety of computer vision problems. However its application is usually limited to problems with a one dimensional or low treewidth structure, whereas most domains in vision are at least 2D. In this paper we show how to apply DP for pixel labeling of 2D scenes with simple “tiered” structure. While there are many variations possible, for the applications we consider the following tiered structure is appropriate. An image is first divided by horizontal curves into the top, middle, and bottom regions, and the middle region is further subdivided vertically into subregions. Under these constraints a globally optimal labeling can be found using an efficient dynamic programming algorithm. We apply this algorithm to two very different tasks. The first is the problem of geometric class labeling where the goal is to assign each pixel a label such as “sky”, “ground”, and “surface above ground”. The second task involves incorporating simple shape priors for segmentation of an image into the “foreground” and “background” regions.},

abstract = {An algorithm, the bootstrap filter, is proposed for implementing recursive Bayesian filters. The required density of the state vector is represented as a set of random samples, which are updated and propagated by the algorithm. The method is not restricted by assumptions of linearity or Gaussian noise: it may be applied to any state transition or measurement model. A simulation example of the bearings only tracking problem is presented. This simulation includes schemes for improving the efficiency of the basic algorithm. For this example, the performance of the bootstrap filter is greatly superior to the standard extended Kalman filter},
