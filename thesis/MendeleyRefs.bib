abstract = {This paper presents a fully automatic method for creating a 3D model from a single photograph. The model is made up of several texture-mapped planar billboards and has the complexity of a typical children's pop-up book illustration. Our main insight is that instead of attempting to recover precise geometry, we statistically model geometric classes defined by their orientations in the scene. Our algorithm labels regions of the input image into coarse categories: "ground", "sky", and "vertical". These labels are then used to "cut and fold" the image into a pop-up model using a set of simple assumptions. Because of the inherent ambiguity of the problem and the statistical nature of the approach, the algorithm is not expected to work on every image. However. it performs surprisingly well for a wide range of scenes taken from a typical person's photo album.},

abstract = {Thesupport-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},

@article{Canny1986,
abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

@book{MacKay2003,
abstract = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes - the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self- learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in computer vision is how to determine the 3-D spatial orientation of curves and surfaces appearing in an image. The problem is generally underconstrained, and is complicated by the fact that metric properties, such as orientation and length, are not invariant under projection. Under perspective projection (the correct model for most real images) the transform is nonlinear, and therefore hard to invert. Two constructive methods are presented. The first finds the orientation of parallel lines and planes by locating vanishing points and vanishing lines. The second determines the orientation of planes by ‘backprojection’ of two intrinsic properties of contours: angle magnitude and curvature.},

@article{Bellman1952,
abstract = {Populations threatened by extinction are often far below their carrying capacity. A population collapse or quasi-extinction is defined to occur when the population size reaches some given lower density. If this density is chosen to be large enough for the demographic stochasticity to be ignored compared to environmental stochasticity, then the logarithm of the population size may be modelled by a Brownian motion until quasi-extinction occurs. The normal-gamma mixture of inverse Gaussian distributions can then be applied to define prediction intervals for the time to quasi-extinction in such processes. A similar mixture is used to predict the population size at a finite time for the same process provided that quasi-extinction has not occurred before that time. Stochastic simulations indicate that the coverage of the prediction interval is very close to the probability calculated theoretically. As an illustration, the method is applied to predict the time to extinction of a declining population of white stork in southwestern Germany. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},
