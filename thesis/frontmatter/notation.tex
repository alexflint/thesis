\vspace*{20mm}{\Large\bf\begin{center}Notation\end{center}}\label{sec:Notation}Throughout this thesis, the following conventions will be used fortypesetting mathematics unless otherwise indicated:\begin{itemize}\item{\bf 2D and general Vectors} are written in lower case bold: $\vec{a}$,and a unit vector with a hat $\uvec{a}$. Where important todifferentiate between homogeneous and non-homogeneous vectors, thelatter will appear as$\vec{\tilde{a}}$. Vectors are usually column vectors,with elements specified by subscript index (eg.\$\vec{x}=(x_1,x_2)\tra$). \item{\bf 3D Vectors}  are written in upper case bold: $\vec{A}$, with similar conventions to 2D vectors.\item{\bf Matrices} are written in teletype: $\mat{A}$, and may have size indicated,$\mat{A}_{3\times4}$. Where a matrix is square $\mat{A}_3$ is a $3\times 3$ matrix.The entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column of the matrix is $\matd{A}{ij}$.\item{\bf Tensors} are written in bold calligraphic:$\tensorud{T}{jk}i$,$\tensoru{Q}{ijkl}$.\item{\bf Quaternions} are written as$\quat{a}$.\item{\bf Projective Equality} (see Appendix\ref{Section:Homogeneous}) is denoted $\projeq$ ~.\end{itemize}
